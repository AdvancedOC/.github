# AdvancedOC
This is an organization used for storing the repositories for a bunch of OpenComputers-related projects.
## What is OpenComputers?
[OpenComputers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencomputers) is a Minecraft mod that adds computers that are programmed in Lua.
### Why OpenComputers, and not ComputerCraft?
OpenComputers provides more limitations, and has the ability to write proper custom OSes. It also has some lower level features than ComputerCraft. This makes it more fun for us to work with.
## So, what are you working on?
We're currently mainly working on [KOCOS](https://github.com/AdvancedOC/KOCOS), a kernel which we will use to make an OS in the future, but we have some other projects here aswell:
- [FrostOS](https://github.com/AdvancedOC/FrostOS): this was our first succesful attempt at writing an OpenComputers OS.
- [Diskless](https://github.com/AdvancedOC/Diskless): this is a library you can use to create virtualized filesystems in RAM, which was used to make the live installer for FrostOS work.
- [TinyOC](https://github.com/AdvancedOC/TinyOC): a very basic OpenComputers emulator written in Lua with Love2D. It doesn't implement much, but can run some basic OSes, and is somewhat useful for testing.
## Partners:
We currently only have a singular partnered organization:
- [LibreFlock](https://github.com/LibreFlock/): this is an organization that also does OpenComputers-related projects, that's owned by some of our friends.
